# DocbookConverter

This library provides .NET classes, written in C#, to easily convert to and from Docbook and Xaml Packages (from FlowDocuments).

It currently supports a limited set of tags, but it can and will be updated, especially if any motivated developers decide to contribute.

The current version is far from complete, supporting only the strict necessary to make an internal project work.

Docbook code can be generated from Xaml Packages coming from a RichTextBox's FlowDocument. The following are supported:

1. Paragraphs
2. Bold text
3. Italic text
4. Ordered lists
5. Bullet lists
6. Images
